<b>Custom icons for wifi marauder</b>

## .bmp icons for the menu of marauder

<b>Custom icons are a little bit more tricky than the boot screens, but it can be done in a few steps. <br> Use the bmp files above in this repo <a href=https://www.imageconvert.org/bmp-to-xbm>here</a> to convert them to XBM code.
You will need to make sure the bmp files are 20 pixels x 20 pixels before use the online converter tool. <br> For a good looking menu icon you will want to remove the background from the bmp file and still save it as .bmp file. <br> The code that the converter gives you will be used to replace code in the assets.cpp file just like we do when making custom boot screens. I will post a image showing where the code is to make it simple. Keep in mind the code in the assets.cpp file at the top of the file are the menu items. they are labeled to match the icon. Try to keep the layout of the full bit of code just as is with the name of the menu item so you will not loose track of what is what. </b>
